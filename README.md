# sgRNA filtering procedure
The code provided here refers to the sgRNA filtering procedure described in "Multi-Knock â€“ a multi-targeted genome-scale CRISPR toolbox to overcome functional redundancy in plants" (Hu et al., 2023).
Note: The scripts were based on the original version of CRISPys. An updated version that uses a more efficient code for the sgRNA filtering procedure is currently available at https://github.com/MayroseLab/CRISPys_Crunch.
